üìä Supervised Learning
1. Linear Regression
Purpose: Predict continuous values using a straight-line relationship
Idea: Find the best-fit line that minimizes the distance between predicted and actual values
Use Case: House price prediction, stock price forecasting, sales forecasting

2. Logistic Regression
Purpose: Binary classification using probability estimates
Idea: Uses S-shaped curve to predict class probabilities between 0 and 1
Use Case: Spam detection, disease diagnosis, customer churn prediction

3. Decision Trees
Purpose: Classification and regression using tree-like decisions
Idea: Builds flowchart of questions to split data into homogeneous groups
Use Case: Customer segmentation, loan approval, medical diagnosis

4. Random Forest
Purpose: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
Idea: Wisdom of the crowd - multiple trees vote for final prediction
Use Case: Feature importance, robust classification, regression tasks

5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Purpose: Classification by finding optimal separation boundary
Idea: Maximizes margin between classes using support vectors
Use Case: Text classification, image recognition, bioinformatics

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Purpose: Classification based on similarity to nearest data points
Idea: "Birds of a feather flock together" - classify by majority vote of neighbors
Use Case: Recommendation systems, pattern recognition, anomaly detection

üîç Unsupervised Learning
7. K-Means Clustering
Purpose: Partition data into K distinct clusters
Idea: Group similar points around centroids using distance minimization
Use Case: Customer segmentation, image compression, document clustering

8. Hierarchical Clustering
Purpose: Build tree-like cluster hierarchy
Idea: Creates dendrogram showing relationships at different similarity levels
Use Case: Phylogenetic trees, social network analysis, organizational structuring

9. DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
Purpose: Find clusters based on density connectivity
Idea: Groups dense regions of points, identifies outliers as noise
Use Case: Anomaly detection, spatial data analysis, arbitrary shape clustering

10. Mean-Shift Clustering
Purpose: Find cluster centers through density gradient ascent
Idea: Points "climb hills" to converge at density peaks automatically
Use Case: Image segmentation, object tracking, mode seeking in data

üöÄ Quick Start

# Example: K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# Create and fit model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Get results
labels = kmeans.labels_
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
